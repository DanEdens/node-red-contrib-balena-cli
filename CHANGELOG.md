## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0

**Important**: This upgrade introduces centralized authentication. You'll need to configure authentication for existing nodes.

**Migration Steps**:
1. **Create a Balena Config Node**:
   - Add a new `balena-config` node to your workspace
   - Configure your preferred authentication method
   - Test the connection to ensure it works

2. **Update Existing Nodes**:
   - Edit each existing Balena node (device, fleet, ssh, variables, deploy)
   - Select the Balena Config node in the configuration
   - Deploy your changes

3. **Verify Operation**:
   - Test your flows to ensure authentication works
   - Monitor the config node status for authentication state
   - Check that all operations complete successfully

**Benefits After Migration**:
- No more manual CLI login required
- Automatic authentication management
- Support for multiple authentication methods
- Enhanced security with API tokens
- openBalena instance support

![Authentication](https://img.shields.io/badge/auth-integrated-green)
![Nodes](https://img.shields.io/badge/nodes-6-brightgreen)

A comprehensive Node-RED wrapper for the Balena CLI, providing powerful IoT device and fleet management capabilities directly within Node-RED flows.

## Overview

This Node-RED contribution package provides six specialized nodes that wrap the Balena CLI, enabling seamless integration of Balena IoT operations into Node-RED automation workflows:

- **balena-config**: Configuration node for authentication and connection management
- **balena-device**: Device management and control
- **balena-fleet**: Fleet lifecycle and configuration management
- **balena-ssh**: SSH access and command execution on devices
- **balena-variables**: Environment variable management for fleets and devices
- **balena-deploy**: Code deployment and release management
- **balena-supervisor**: Local supervisor operations for nodes running on balena devices

## Authentication

### Balena Configuration Node

The `balena-config` node provides centralized authentication management for all Balena operations. It supports three login methods:

1. **Email & Password** - Traditional login with Balena account credentials
2. **API Token** - Token-based authentication (recommended for production)
3. **Browser Login** - Interactive browser-based login (development only)

#### Getting API Tokens
For production deployments, API tokens are recommended:

1. Login to the [Balena Dashboard](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com)
2. Go to Preferences ‚Üí Access Tokens
3. Click "Create API Token"
4. Give it a name and copy the token
5. Use the token in your `balena-config` node

#### openBalena Support
For openBalena instances, simply change the API URL in the config node to match your deployment (e.g., `https://api.openbalena.local`).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Balena CLI** - Install the Balena CLI and ensure it's in your system PATH:
   ```bash
   npm install -g balena-cli
   ```

2. **Balena Account** - You'll need either:
   - A Balena Cloud account (free at [balena.io](https://balena.io))
   - Access to an openBalena instance
   - An API token for authentication

3. **Node-RED** - Ensure Node-RED is installed and running

**Note:** You no longer need to manually login to the Balena CLI as authentication is handled automatically by the `balena-config` node.

### Install the Package

#### Via Node-RED Palette Manager
1. Open Node-RED in your browser
2. Go to the hamburger menu ‚Üí Manage Palette
3. Click the "Install" tab
4. Search for `node-red-contrib-balena-cli`
5. Click "Install"

#### Via npm
```bash
cd ~/.node-red
npm install node-red-contrib-balena-cli
```

#### Manual Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MadnessEngineering/node-red-contrib-balena-cli.git
cd node-red-contrib-balena-cli
npm install
npm link
cd ~/.node-red
npm link node-red-contrib-balena-cli
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Authentication
First, create a `balena-config` node:
1. Drag a `balena-config` node to your flow
2. Double-click to configure it
3. Choose your login method (Email/Password, API Token, or Browser)
4. Enter your credentials
5. Test the connection
6. Deploy the configuration

### 2. Basic Device Listing
```json
{
  "operation": "list",
  "fleet": "my-iot-fleet"
}
```

### 3. SSH Command Execution
```json
{
  "operation": "command",
  "deviceUuid": "1234567890abcdef",
  "command": "df -h"
}
```

### 4. Environment Variable Management
```json
{
  "operation": "set",
  "scope": "fleet",
  "target": "my-iot-fleet",
  "variableName": "API_URL",
  "variableValue": "https://api.example.com"
}
```

**Note**: `balena-variables` and `balena-deploy` nodes will be updated with authentication integration in v1.2.0. For now, ensure you're logged in via the CLI manually when using these nodes.

1. **Inject node** ‚Üí triggers every 5 minutes
2. **balena-device** ‚Üí `list` operation with fleet filter
3. **Function node** ‚Üí filter offline devices
4. **Switch node** ‚Üí route if any offline devices found
5. **Notification** ‚Üí send alert

1. **File Watch** ‚Üí monitors code directory
2. **balena-deploy** ‚Üí `push` operation with nocache option
3. **balena-device** ‚Üí `restart` all devices in fleet
4. **Notification** ‚Üí deployment success/failure alert

## Performance & Caching

### Caching Strategy
- **Read operations** (list, info, logs) are cached by default
- **Write operations** always execute fresh
- Cache keys include operation and parameters
- Configurable cache duration per node

### Timeout Management
- Default timeouts are optimized per operation type
- Build operations: 30 minutes
- Standard operations: 30 seconds
- SSH operations: 30 seconds
- Configurable per node instance

### Resource Usage
- Minimal memory footprint with optional caching
- Efficient CLI command execution
- Concurrent operation support
- Background process management for long operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
